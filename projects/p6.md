## Getting the Starter Code
Navigate to the directory where you would like to store the code for this project. Run the following commands to install the project starter code.
```bash
wget https://robotoperatingsystemscourse.github.io/assets/projects/roscourse-p6-stencil.tar.gz
tar -xf roscourse-p6-stencil.tar.gz
rm roscourse-p6-stencil.tar.gz
```
It is *strongly* recommended to use GitHub to track the changes made to your project. First, create a new **private** repository in GitHub. Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following commands.
```bash
git init
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin [LINK TO REPO]
git push -u origin main
```
This will establish a main branch on the remote repository and add the starter code as the first commit.
