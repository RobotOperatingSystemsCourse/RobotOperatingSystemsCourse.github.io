# Projects

## Getting the Code
To get the template code for completing your projects, go to the Canvas assignments page and use the GitHub Classroom link on the current project's assignment. This link will allow you to generate a repository for your template code while automatically giving course staff access. Clone and push commits to this repository to complete your projects.
